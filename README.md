In this project i developed an application to manage outcomes and incomes in personal financial life, you can insert and vizualize your total incomes, total outcomes, and total money after all the transactions. You can also make a search for specific transactions ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸  

### What technologies i used?
This project was made in **React + Vite + TypeScript**, it was very helpful to understand React hooks like **useEffect**, **useState**, **useForm**, the creation and usage of contexts with **useContext**, the usage of libraries like **Phosphor React** for icons, **Zod** for forms validadion and declaration, **Radix** for accessible components and the usage of API's using a fake API made with Json Server.

If you're tying the App don't forget to initialize the Json Server ðŸ˜‰
